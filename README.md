Important Features ---------------------------------------

Stealth: 
- Your ship has an emission signature radius that can be seen in the ship info panel or by pressing "c".
- When an NPC ship enters your emission signature radius it will detect you. 
- You and NPC ships have a sensor blind spot that is directly behind the main drive. Firing the main thruster blinds you to contacts that are behind your ship.
- You will be notified near the ship info panel when an NPC ship or torpedo has sensor locked you (this means you are detected and being pursued).
- Gas clouds are environmental features that block all sensors.  
- Your sensors will be completely useless when inside a gas cloud (your minimap will be disabled).
- When outside a gas cloud, your sensors cannot pass through to see contacts on the other side.
- NPC ships are affected the same way by gas clouds. However, NPC ships and torpedos can see you if you are in the same gas cloud as them.
- Using stealth effectively is your best chance to defeat NPC capital ships.

Combat:  
- There are two weapon types in the game: Point Defense Cannons (PDCs) and torpedos. 
- PDCs are used for close range combat and for intercepting torpedos. 
- You have unlimited ammunition, but you must reload PDC magazines and torpedos.
- NPC ships will intercept your torpedos with their PDCs. 
- You can intercept NPC torpedos with your PDCs as well, but you can also fire your torpedos at NPC torpedos. Often, a single defensive torpedo can destroy most of an NPC torpedo barrage.
- NPC ships have ammunition magazines that they must periodically reload. Catching an NPC ship in the middle of a PDC or torpedo reload can be useful.

Ship Modules:
- Your ship is made of modules that control most aspects of your ship.
- Modules can be damaged in combat, but you can repair them one at a time.
- For example, a damaged torpedo tube module will prevent you loading and firing torpedos, a damaged sensor module will disable your sensors (your minimap will be offline), and a damaged main drive will disable your engine.
- Damaged modules can impose severe limitations on your ability to operate your ship. Repairing is very important.

Gameplay:
- The current build of the game does not have a win condition. Simply exit a level once you have destroyed all the NPC ships.

Thank you for playing, and I hope you enjoy the game.
