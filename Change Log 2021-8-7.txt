Additions:
- Added a UI panel that appears to notify the player when they are detected by the AI. 
- Added a toggleable circle around the player ship that shows the range at which an AI
can detect the player ship.

the AI will wander in the general direction from where the attack came from.
Fixes: 
- Fixed AI bug that caused inaccurate PDC aiming when shooting at incoming torpedoes.
